## About

This is a personal demo project created in my free time,
for learning and portfolio purposes.

The application is inspired by real-world business scenarios,
but it is NOT based on any company's production code.

All functionality, structure, and data were implemented independently.

MVC project demonstrating Builder Design Pattern for generating bank account statements with SQL procedures, triggers, and file export (CSV,Excel, PDF) and a simple frontend interfacewith(Razor, html,css,Javacript,Jquery,and boostrap). Highlights OOP, clean architecture, and real-world banking workflow simulation.
